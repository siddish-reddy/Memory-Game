A project for the course Web Programming in Javascript which gave us the chance to combine all the things we learnt about HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
##### How to play the game
 Flip the card, memorize it and try to match it with same card with minimum possible moves.
##### Features:
 - CSS Animations for flipping the card, matching, unmatched conditions
 - Timer to track down time taken for completion. Stars based upon the moves took to win.
 - Popup when player wins the game, option to restart the game
### Dependencies:
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/getting-started?using=web-fonts-with-css).
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
#### TODOS:
- [ ] Add unique functionality beyond the minimum requirements (Implement a leaderboard, store game state using local storage, etc.)
- [ ] Implement additional optimizations that improve the performance and user experience of the game (keyboard shortcuts for gameplay, etc).
